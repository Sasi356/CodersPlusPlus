# -----Advanced Object Identification in Images-----

## About the project:
   In this project we have performed the detection and masking of an object using **MRCNN(MASK-REGIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK)** deep learning technique and also identification of grid of images(cells) in which the object was spread. The object to be identified belongs to one of the categories: (1) Vehicles such as cars and motorcycles, (2) Road signage such as zebra crossings and traffic lights, and (3) Structures such as bridges and buildings etc.
