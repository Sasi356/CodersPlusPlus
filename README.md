# Coders++
# -----Advanced Object Identification in Images-----

## About the project:
   In this project we have performed the object detection and instance segmentation of an object using **DETECTRON2** platform by **MRCNN(MASK-REGIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK)** deep learning technique and and also performed identification of grid of images(cells) in which the object was spread. The object to be identified belongs to one of the categories: (1) Vehicles such as cars and motorcycles, (2) Road signage such as zebra crossings and traffic lights, and (3) Structures such as bridges and buildings etc.
   
## DETECTRON2 and MRCNN(MASK-REGIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK)
   ### DETECTRON2
   Detectron2 is one of the most popular open source library and API developed at Facebook's AI research wing which provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms such as semantic, instance segmentations etc., including DensePose, panoptic feature pyramid networks, and numerous variants of the pioneering Mask R-CNN model family. Its extensible design makes it easy to implement cutting-edge research projects without having to fork the entire codebase.
